Food order app is the web application that allow users to select the food item and
add them to the cart. The users can also delete the food item from the cart if they
accidentally added them. As we know that all kinds of applications are managed
by admins. So, in this application I have also implemented the functionality for the
admins. Basically, admins can add the new food items and delete them if they are
not available for users to buy.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

For this project, I am using json-server api and included in a compressed file.  Please unzip, and in the directory, run `npm start`
